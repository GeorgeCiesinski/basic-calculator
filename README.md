# Basic Calculator
Basic calculator built using Python 3 and Kivy.

## Motivation
I wanted to make a GUI project to build something visual in Python.

## Screenshots
The Basic Calculator opens in the below size:

But it can also be resized. Unfortunately, the text is not resizable:

The calculator works by clicking the desired buttons:
